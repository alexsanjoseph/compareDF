\title{Compare Two dataframes}
\usage{
compare_df(df_new, df_old, group_col, exclude = NULL, limit_html = 100,
  tolerance = 0, tolerance_type = "ratio", stop_on_error = TRUE,
  keep_unchanged = FALSE, color_scheme = c(addition = "green", removal =
  "red", unchanged_cell = "gray", unchanged_row = "deepskyblue"))
}
\arguments{
\item{df_new}{The data frame for which any changes will be shown as an addition (green)}

\item{df_old}{The data frame for which any changes will be shown as a removal (red)}

\item{group_col}{A character vector of a string of character vector showing the columns
by which to group_by.}

\item{exclude}{The columns which should be excluded from the comparison}

\item{limit_html}{maximum number of rows to show in the html diff. >1000 not recommended}

\item{tolerance}{The amount in fraction to which changes are ignored while showing the
visual representation. By default, the value is 0 and any change in the value of variables
is shown off. Doesn't apply to categorical variables.}

\item{tolerance_type}{Defaults to 'ratio'. The type of comparison for numeric values, can be 'ratio' or 'difference'}

\item{stop_on_error}{Whether to stop on acceptable errors on not}

\item{keep_unchanged}{whether to preserve unchanged values or not. Defaults to FALSE}

\item{color_scheme}{What color scheme to use for the HTML output. Should be a vector/list with
named_elements. Default - c("addition" = "green", "removal" = "red", "unchanged_cell" = "gray", "unchanged_row" = "deepskyblue")}

Do a git style comparison between two data frames of similar columnar structure
